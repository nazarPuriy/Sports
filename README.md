This repository was part of a project for Distributed Software course at the University of Barcelona. The project was done by me and a fellow student and guided by the professors above.
We created a page where you can register and buy products, tickets to matches in this case, with all the back-end and front-end needed. As part of the project we used Flask and Vue frameworks.
